The base version of this project won 2nd place (out of 48) in an advanced statistical learning undergraduate course in maximizing coverage & accuracy measured in RMSE. However, I'm currently revamping it to include easier-to-read code, added feature engineering, and pre-processing (data was given that was already cleaned, but I'd like to demonstrate newly learned cleaning methods).
